#Linux Server Configuration

This is the fifth and final project in my pursuit of the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. Following is Udacity's description for this project:

You will take a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepare it to host your web applications, to include installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers. A deep understanding of exactly what your web applications are doing, how they are hosted, and the interactions between multiple systems are what define you as a Full Stack Web Developer. In this project, youâ€™ll be responsible for turning a brand-new, bare bones, Linux server into the secure and efficient web application host your applications need.
```

```

##WEB ACCESS INSTRUCTIONS
To access the hosted web application, visit one of the two web URLs listed below. The links are only temporary, however, since the virtual machine only needs to be provisioned long enough for this project to be graded by Udacity.

- http://52.34.202.209
- http://ec2-52-34-202-209.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com


If you have a Google account, you can log into the application using the Google Sign-In button in the upper-right of the page. However, you will not have write-access to the site until I approve your account in my custom user-management console. Once you've been approved, you can create new items in the various categories of the catalog.
```

```

##SSH ACCESS INSTRUCTIONS
To access the server via SSH, use the information below. This information is only temporary, however, since the virtual machine only needs to be provisioned long enough for this project to be graded by Udacity.
```
Server IP: 52.34.202.209
SSH Port: 2200

Example: ssh -i ~/.ssh/udacity_key.rsa -p 2200 grader@52.34.202.209
```

*A private key (`udacity_key.rsa`) is required to access SSH and this information is only being shared with
the Udacity project reviewer.*
```

```

##REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITY
- Configured and secured Amazon EC2 virtual server running Ubuntu
- Performed necessary config to host my [ItemCatalog application](http://github.com/richgieg/ItemCatalog) (Udacity Full Stack Project #3) using Apache and PostgreSQL
```

```

##ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY

**Enabled UFW limit rule so repeated SSH connection attempts will be blocked**

Testing & Verification Instructions:

1. Initiate SSH connection
2. Logoff
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 as rapidly as possible, until the server starts to refuse connections. After roughly 30 seconds, you should be able to reconnect.

**Enabled automatic weekly updates, with logging, using Cron and Apt-Get**

Testing & Verification Instructions:

1. `sudo run-parts -v /etc/cron.weekly`
2. `ls /var/log/autoupdate`
3. `cat /var/log/autoupdate/########-####.log` (#'s are placeholders)

**Enabled application monitoring via Monit**

Testing & Verification Instructions:

1. `sudo monit status` to verify services are running
2. `sudo service postgresql stop`
3. `sudo service apache2 stop`
4. `sudo service ssh stop`
5. Log out of SSH session
6. Try logging in, but observe that it fails because SSH service stopped
7. Wait two minutes
8. Log back in via SSH, since SSH service should be restarted by now
9. `sudo monit status` to verify all services are running again
```

```

##MY CONFIGURATION STEPS
```
# Connect to Amazon VM as root (x.x.x.x is the server IP).
ssh -i ~/.ssh/udacity_key.rsa root@x.x.x.x

#Create the grader user account.
adduser grader

# Add grader user account to the sudo group.
adduser grader sudo

# Move authorized_keys file from root to grader, effectively disabling
# public key authentication for root and enabling it for the grader account.
mv .ssh /home/grader
chown -R grader:grader /home/grader/.ssh

# Edit /etc/hosts in order to map the current hostname to 127.0.0.1 to
# prevent the "unable to resolve host" error message when using sudo.
nano /etc/hosts

# Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Ensure sshd_config has the following settings:
Port 2200
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no

# Restart SSH service.
service ssh restart

# Disconnect the root session.
exit

# Reconnect to Amazon VM as grader (x.x.x.x is the server IP).
ssh -i ~/.ssh/udacity_key.rsa -p 2200 grader@x.x.x.x

# Configure firewall to allow only SSH (TCP), HTTP (TCP) and NTP (UDP).
# Typically I would only allow SSH connections from the IP of the machine
# I would be using to initiate SSH connections. However, in this case
# ,since the project reviewer will need SSH access, I will be allowing
# SSH from any IP.
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw limit 2200/tcp
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 123/udp
